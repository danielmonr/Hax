# Ethical Hacking Final Project

This project (script) automatize the usage of `recon-ng`, `nmap`, `metasploit console` and `WPScan` with Kali.

The file that runs all of this is: `hax_1.sh`, and it runs like this:

```
chmod 755
./hax_1.sh <domain or ips>
```

The `PoC.mp4` is the video that shows the ussage of the script.
